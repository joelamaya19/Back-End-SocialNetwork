# Back-End-SocialNetwork

## Description

The Social Network API is a backend application designed to support a social networking platform where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and maintain a list of friends. The application utilizes MongoDB for database management, leveraging its speed and flexibility in handling large amounts of unstructured data. The API is built using Express.js for routing and the Mongoose ODM for seamless interaction with the MongoDB database.

## Features

- **User Management**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve users.
- **Thought Management**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve thoughts posted by users.
- **Reactions**: Add and remove reactions to thoughts.
- **Friend List**: Add and remove friends from a user's friend list.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity with Mongoose schema validation.
- **Virtuals**: Use Mongoose virtuals to dynamically calculate fields like friend count and reaction count.
- **Timestamps**: Format timestamps for user-friendly display using getter methods.
